# 🎭 Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition System

## 🚀 Overview

This project presents a **real-time facial expression recognition and behavioral analysis system** designed to dynamically analyze human emotions from live video feeds. The system focuses on understanding **ethical, analytical, and real-time emotional recognition** in unconstrained, real-world environments and explores its application in monitoring and proctoring scenarios.

The work extends beyond implementation and is backed by **published academic research**, with extended experimentation and system-level improvements carried out after publication.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **🎥 Live Facial Expression Detection**  
  Detects and classifies human facial expressions in real time using deep learning models applied to live video streams.

- **⚠️ Behavioral & Malpractice Detection**  
  Identifies suspicious behaviors such as the presence of **unauthorized objects (e.g., mobile phones, tablets)** in monitored environments like examination halls.

- **🔴 Real-Time Object Highlighting**  
  Flags detected suspicious objects with **red-line visual markers**, enabling immediate attention and action.

- **🤖 Automated Monitoring Support**  
  Assists human reviewers by reducing manual effort in analyzing live or recorded footage, improving efficiency and consistency.

## 🔍 System Workflow

1. Captures **live video input** from a camera feed.
2. Applies **computer vision techniques** to detect faces and track expressions.
3. Uses **deep learning (CNN-based models)** to classify emotional states.
4. Detects unidentified or prohibited objects in the frame.
5. Highlights suspicious detections in real time for visual alerting.
