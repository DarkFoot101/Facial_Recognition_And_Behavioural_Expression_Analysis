🎭 Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition System

🚀 Overview

This project implements a real-time facial recognition system that detects human facial expressions dynamically. It can analyze live video feeds to identify emotions and potential suspicious activities, enhancing monitoring systems.

🛠️ Features

✔ Live Facial Expression Detection – Analyzes and classifies emotions in real-time.

✔ Malpractice Detection – Flags suspicious activities such as using unauthorized objects (e.g., mobile phones) in examination settings.

✔ Red-Line Highlighting – Marks detected suspicious objects in real-time, allowing proctors to act quickly.

✔ Automated Monitoring – Reduces manual effort in reviewing recorded footage.

🔍 How It Works

Uses computer vision and deep learning to track and classify facial expressions.

Detects unidentified objects (e.g., mobile phones, tablets) and marks them in red for real-time alerting.

Provides a visual interface for easy proctor decision-making.
